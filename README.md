# Decals
Ceramics digital print image repository

Notes:

Photo decal paper from Baltaxia (https://baltaxia.lt/lt/produktas/foto-dekolinis-popierius/) is not A4 but letter size. 
To print with our HP printer, paper size and thickness must be changed (letter, thicker paper). It's also useful to adjust print density in other print options.
